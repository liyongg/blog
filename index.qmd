## 🇳🇱 🇨🇳 ✌🏻

Hey there! 
I'm Li Yong, aka Michel. 
When I'm not doing tech savvy things, you'll likely find me enjoying video games with friends, passionately cheering for Real Madrid or spending time with my lovely girlfriend.
I thrive on solving challenging problems, and often find myself thinking faster than I speak & speaking faster than I think.
Every day, I enjoy pondering ways to *game the system* and exploring questions that often go unnoticed.
