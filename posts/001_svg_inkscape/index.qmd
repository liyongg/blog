## Why?

One of the things that bother me a lot, is when graphics are not embedded as an *SVG* file[^1].
In particular, for graphics shared on the web there should be no reason to use raster images.
The scalability of the SVG extension is what makes it incredibly powerful when displaying graphics at various sizes: there is no loss of quality when resizing an SVG image.
This also means that when embedding an SVG image onto a website, resizing the webpage or zooming in and out does not result in blurry images (pixels).
For some reason I find myself zooming in and out a lot on websites...
Anyway, there are other reasons to use the SVG format, such as the interactivity it provides when using JavaScript code.
You can add transitions to the SVG in HTML if you'd fancy.
Besides the interactivity, it is also easy to edit or modify existing SVG files.
One of the well-known editing programs is the open source software [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/ "It's open source and has several other amazing features!").

[^1]: For photographs, screenshots or images with complex details, the raster extensions (PNG, JPG, JPEG) are perfectly fine!

For today, we will be using an existing raster image and use Inkscape to create a graphic that captures the main shapes of the image.
At the moment of writing, the first blog post did not have an image yet.
Let's make one!

## MIA

First we have to find a suitable image that we can use for the [first post](../000_expectations/index.qmd).
As it is about expectations and what to expect so...
a question mark should do!
But what kind of question mark?
The first one that comes to my mind has to be the iconic *missing ping* from the popular MOBA game: [League of Legends](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/ "MOBA game by Riot Games, since 2009").
I entered a practice game and cropped a screenshot:

![](missing.jpg){fig-align="center"}

We will be using this `missing.jpg` file and the output will be a `missing.svg` file.

1.  Open Inkscape.

2.  In the top bar, select *File \> Open* or use the shortcut {{< kbd Ctrl+O >}}.

3.  Navigate to the `missing.jpg` file and select it.

4.  If a window of 'jpeg bitmap image import' pops up, I have selected the OK with the following:

    -   Image Importy Type: Embed

    -   Image DPI: From file

    -   Image Rendering Mode: Smooth (optimizeQuality)

5.  A new window of Inkscape opens with the `missing.jpg` file.

6.  Select the image, and in the top bar select *Path \> Trace Bitmap...* or use the shortcut {{< kbd Shift+Alt+B >}}.

7.  The *Trace Bitmap* window should pop up with a preview of the resulting output.

    ## No preview?

    Make sure to have properly selected the image.
    :::

The *Trace Bitmap window* allows you to finetune the tracing, by changing settings and clicking *Update* after each modification.
I will not be going into too much details, as the SVG graphic that I want to create is not of great importance.
It would also be possible to only focus on the question mark, but after some consideration I actually would like to keep the background.

These are the settings that I used for the final image:

![](settings.png){fig-align="center"}

1.  Click on *OK*.
    The trace should be available and on top of the original image on the canvas.

2.  Remove the original image.

3.  Resize the canvas to the new SVG object by selecting it first

4.  *File \> Document properties* \> *Resize page to drawing or selection*, or use {{< kbd Ctrl+Shift+R >}}.

5.  *File \> Save As...* or {{< kbd Ctrl+Shift+S >}}.

6.  Save it as `missing.svg` and as a *Plain SVG*.

We are done!
The output looks like this:

![](/posts/media\missing.svg){fig-align="center" width="150"}

That's all for today, thanks for reading!

Fun fact: the handsign that serves as both the favicon and logo was also made like this!
