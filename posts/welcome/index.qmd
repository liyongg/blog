On the 9th of January 2024 I decided to start a blog to document small hobby projects publicly. At around 11:40 PM (the time I am usuallly most active with projects like these), I was able to launch the blog successfully using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), combined with my custom (sub)domain [blog.panliyong.nl](https://blog.panliyong.nl). The repository is hosted on GitHub and uses GitHub Actions to update the website automatically on every push to the `main` branch.

The current idea of this blog is to demonstrate small personal projects to illustrate proficiency of techniques in data science and web development. I have a few ideas in mind and will try to showcase them in upcoming blog posts. However, the first step is to allow comments on (some) blog posts from GitHub users. Stay tuned!
